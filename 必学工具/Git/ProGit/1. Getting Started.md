# 1.1 About Version Control
background on Version Control Tools(VCS)
- **Version Control**
	Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
- **Local Version Control Systems**
	copy files into another directory?->Ã—
	keep *all the changes* to files under version control

	- **RCS(Revision Control System)**
		-> keep patch sets(the differences between files)
- **Centralized Version Control Systems(CVCS)**
	need to collaborate with developers on other systems
	-> a single server that contains all the versioned files and a number of clients check out files from the central place

	- Pros
		- everyone knows what others are doing
		- administrator have fine-grained control over who can do what
		- easy to administer
	- Cons
		- failure of the centralized server
		- weak backup
- Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS)
	-> do not just check out the files, but *mirror the repository including its full history*
