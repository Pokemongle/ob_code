# Part 1
## Problem 1
Buffer
1. The key is to write `create_generator` which uses `yield`, also remember to use `for` loop on the generator
2. The thought of "buffer"
	This is implemented by: `self.current` is one element ahead of the return value of `pop_first`
## Problem 2 3
They are easy and boring
Use `Pair()`
