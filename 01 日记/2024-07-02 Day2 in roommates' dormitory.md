# Funny things
- Try Batleys whiskey. Sweet and spicy, burns my throat, makes my eyes red, my body hot.

# Record
data in the form of .mat is not simple array like [59, 2400, n], is in the form of directory
```python
import numpy as np
data = zeros(59,2400,48)
data = np.array(data)
sample_matdata_dir = {
	"datas":data	   
}
# now save sample_matdata_dir into .mat file
```
