我的房子天花板有的时候会冒蓝光，我一直以为是房东在我的房间里面装了摄像头，但是这也太不隐蔽了。我这段时间的心情很阴郁，虽然经历了圣诞和元旦两个大假期，我已经在家里躺了差不多快3周了。今天早上大概八点钟那道蓝光又出现了，但是好像来自窗户外面。我拉开窗帘，发现是街对面的广告牌透过我没有窗帘的最上层窗户传进来的，广告牌用的还是 windows 系统。世界早上好，我要睡觉了。
Recently, there's been this mysterious blue light appearing on my ceiling from time to time. I've been feeling quite down, and even though I've had the Christmas and New Year's holidays off, I've spent almost three weeks just lying around at home. This morning, around eight o'clock, the blue light showed up again, and it seemed to be coming from outside my window. I pulled back the curtains to find out that it was the glow from a billboard across the street, shining through my top window which doesn't have any curtains. The billboard is running on a Windows system. Good morning, world. Now, I'm off to get some sleep.
