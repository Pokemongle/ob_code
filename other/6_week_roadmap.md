#### Tasks:
1. Watch **1-2 videos per day** (aim for 30 minutes a day).
2. At the end of each video, try **explaining the concept in your own words** (either by writing or speaking).
3. Practice **5–10 problems** daily, focusing on matrix operations and eigenvalues/eigenvectors.

---

### Calculus for Machine Learning:
- **Key Concepts**: Derivatives, chain rule, gradients, partial derivatives, optimization (e.g., gradient descent)

#### Tasks:
1. Watch **1 video per day** (aim for 30 minutes a day).
2. Practice solving derivative problems (focus on gradients and simple functions).
3. Make sure to **apply** the concept to real ML problems — gradient descent is a major part of ML.

## Week 3: Python & ML Basics

### Goal: Refresh Python and start understanding **ML theory** and how math applies to real models.

---

### Python Refresher:
- **Key Topics**: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib (Data manipulation, plotting, matrix operations)
- **Resources**:
  - [Kaggle Python Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python)
  - [DataCamp Python Tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)

#### Tasks:
1. Spend 1–2 hours per day practicing **Python basics** and working with data (focus on pandas, numpy for matrix operations).
2. **Write small scripts** to process data (e.g., loading a CSV, performing basic statistics, and visualizing data).
3. **Use Matplotlib** to plot functions and equations you learned in the math videos (like linear transformations).

---

### Machine Learning Introduction:

#### Tasks:
1. Learn about **classification** and **regression** models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVMs).
2. **Build a simple model** using scikit-learn on a toy dataset (e.g., Iris dataset).
3. **Evaluate your model** using accuracy, confusion matrix, or other metrics.

## Week 4: Deepen Understanding of ML Algorithms

### Goal: Dive deeper into **machine learning theory** and **basic model building**.

---

### Supervised Learning Models:
- **Key Topics**: Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Resources**:  
  - [Hands-on ML with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
  - [Scikit-learn Documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)

#### Tasks:
1. **Implement Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** in Python.
2. **Experiment with hyperparameters** like tree depth, min samples split, and max features.
3. Start using **cross-validation** to evaluate your models.

---

### Unsupervised Learning (optional, depending on your interests):
- **Key Topics**: K-Means clustering, PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
- **Resources**:
  - [Unsupervised Learning Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EvXgupkpkfQ)
  - [K-Means in Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/text/plot_document_clustering.html)

#### Tasks:
1. Apply **K-Means** to a dataset, visualize clusters.
2. Implement **PCA** to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset.
3. Practice **interpreting** results of clustering.

---

## Week 5: Practical ML Application in Computational Pathology

### Goal: Apply ML to **Computational Pathology** problems.

---

### Computational Pathology Application:
- **Key Topics**: Image classification, patch-level classification, model evaluation
- **Resources**:
  - [Introduction to Deep Learning for Pathology](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/deep-learning)
  - [Deep Learning for Computational Pathology Tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-guide-to-deep-learning-in-pathology-6642b22beff7)

#### Tasks:
1. Apply basic **ML models** to patch-level classification on a pathology dataset (e.g., Kather19, TCGA).
2. Focus on **feature extraction** and **model performance evaluation**.
3. Try using **transfer learning** (using pre-trained models like ResNet or VGG16) for image classification tasks.

---

## Week 6: Project Building & Consolidation

### Goal: Build a small project to consolidate what you’ve learned.

---

### Final Project:
- **Idea**: Apply a **ML model** to a **real dataset** related to your research.  
  For example, build a model for classifying **tumor vs. non-tumor** patches from pathology slides.

#### Tasks:
1. Choose a problem (image classification or regression in pathology).
2. Spend time gathering and cleaning the data.
3. Build and train a model.
4. **Evaluate** the model's performance (AUC, accuracy, F1 score).
5. **Document** your work and write a mini report (even if it’s not perfect).

---

### Ongoing: Keep Learning & Moving Forward

This roadmap is your **launchpad**. After these 6 weeks, you’ll have a good mix of **core math**, **ML theory**, and **practical projects**. As you keep learning, **focus on small, consistent improvements** rather than trying to “compete” with others.

Good luck, and don’t hesitate to ask for help along the way!
