# Dimensions in arrays
- 0-D Arrays/ Scalars
	- elements in an array 
	- `arr = np.array(42)`
- 1-D Arrays 
	- an array that has 0-D arrays as its elements 
- 2-D Arrays 
	- an array that has 1-D arrays as its elements 
- etc 

# Check number of dimensions
	- `print(arr.ndim)`

# Higher Dimensional Arrays 
`arr = np.array([1,2,3,4], ndmin=5)`
