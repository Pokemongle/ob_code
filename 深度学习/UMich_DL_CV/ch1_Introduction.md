**Early AI** solves problems that can be <u>described by a list of formal, mathematical rules.</u>

**Challenge**: solve tasks that are <u>easy for people to perform but hard for people to describe formally</u>
e.g. recognize spoken words or faces in images

<b>Deep Learning</b>: learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, <u>the graph is deep, with many layers</u>.
-> How to get subjective and intuitive knowledge into a computer?

**Machine Learning**: <u>extracting patterns from raw data</u>
**feature**: relevant piece of information to a question (e.g. whether to recommend cesarean delivery)
**Challenge**: difficult to know what features should be extracted
