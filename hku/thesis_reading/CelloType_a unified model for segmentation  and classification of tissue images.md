# 1. Terminology
**CelloType**: an end-to-end model designed for <u>cell segmentation and classification</u> for image-based spatial omics data.（基于空间组学信息的细胞分割和分类的端到端模型）
- outperforms other methods in segmentation

A typical analysis workflow of spatial omics data
1. cell segmentation and quantification of molecular analytes (?)
2. cell type annotation

Conventional analysis pipelines:
	do segmentation and classification sequentially
